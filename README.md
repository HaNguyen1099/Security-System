# Security System

## Introduction
Security Sytem uses facial recognition technology to perform homeowner identification tracking. It automatically records the homeowner's attendance and rings a warning bell, taking photos of strangers entering the homeowner's house.

## Directory Structure
Below is the directory structure of the project:

- `__pycache__`: Directory created by Python.
- `img`: Directory containing homeowner images.
- `imgTest`: Directory containing test images.
- `unknown`: Directory containing images of strangers.
- `Attendance.csv`: List of people and their attendance records.
- `attendance.xlsx`: Excel file storing attendance data.
- `Attendance.py`: Main code for facial recognition and attendance tracking.
- `interface.py`: User interface code for the application.
- `README.md`: Current project description file.

## Usage
This project has a user interface implemented in `interface.py`. The interface consists of the following pages:
- Start Button: Allows you to initiate attendance tracking.
- Unknown Button: Displays the list of strangers's images in folder unknown.
- Attendance Button: Displays the list of people in attendance.xlsx.
